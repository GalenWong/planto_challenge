# My first React-Native App -- Some Cat Facts

## What it does?

It generates cat fact and presents it to you in a nice way.

## How to use?

Well, if it is a react-native app, you can use [Expo](https://expo.io/). 

Just clone the repo and do `npm start` and you are good to go?

Or if you have the emulator, just use the emulator in your computer.
